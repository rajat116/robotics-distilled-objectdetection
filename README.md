# robotics-distilled-objectdetection
Distilled Real-Time Object Detection for Robotics . Train a larger “teacher” YOLO model and distill it into a smaller “student” model.  Benchmark accuracy + latency + model size, track everything with MLflow, deploy the distilled model as a FastAPI microservice in Docker, run it on Kubernetes, and monitor metrics..
